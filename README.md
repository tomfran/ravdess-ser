# Speech emotion recognition on RAVDESS

The goal of the project is to perform speech emotion recognition from audio files. 
The dataset in use contains both songs and speech, by 24 distinct actors performing 8 different emotions. 

You can install the requirements by running: 
```
pip install requirements.txt
```

All the code is organized inside `src` where you can find: 
- `data_preprocessing.py`: feature extraction from raw data;
- `dataset.py`: dataset management, such as splits, scaling, filtering;
- `utility.py`: plots and initial study on the dataset.
